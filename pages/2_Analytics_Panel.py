The sensors were designed to capture real-time data, and they transmitted this information to our central monitoring system. The sensors were periodically calibrated to ensure the accuracy of the measurements.The data collection process was managed by a team of dedicated experts who conducted routine maintenance checks to ensure the sensors were functioning optimally. Each sensor was equipped with GPS for precise location tracking, and data was timestamped to provide a record of when each measurement was taken. This comprehensive approach allowed us to gather valuable insights into the emissions and air quality surrounding these refineries. Our goal was to provide investors and purchasing teams with reliable information regarding the environmental impact of these refineries. The collected data was analyzed to calculate annual carbon reduction metrics, enabling us to report on the refinery's commitment to offsetting carbon emissions.")
